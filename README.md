# TracerVR
TracerVR is a VR prototype made with Unity designed focused on the HTC Vive and wand set. It is a VR adaptation that is designed to mimic a VR version of the gameplay of the Overwatch character Tracer. The prototype is meant to copy her movement style of wrapping forward in front of the facing direction, reverse to a previous position, along with her dual machine gun combat.
